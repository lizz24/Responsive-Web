# TECHNICAL DOCUMENT FOR A RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN


## What is Responsive Web Design?

Responsive web design makes your web page look good on all devices.

- Responsive web design uses only HTML and CSS.
- Responsive web design is not a program or a JavaScript
Designing for all Devices

## Web pages can be viewed using many different devices:

desktops, tablets, and phones. Your web page should look good, and be easy to use, regardless of the device..
It is called responsive web design when you use CSS and HTML to resize, hide, shrink, enlarge, or move the content to make it look good on any screen.
- Web pages should not leave out information to fit smaller devices, but rather adapt its content to fit any device
## The ViewPort
The viewport is the user's visible area of a web page.The viewport varies with the device, and will be smaller on a mobile phone than on a computer screen.

Before tablets and mobile phones, web pages were designed only for computer screens, and it was common for web pages to have a static design and a fixed size.

Then, when we started surfing the internet using tablets and mobile phones, fixed size web pages were too large to fit the viewport. To fix this, browsers on those devices scaled down the entire web page to fit the screen.

Setting The Viewport HTML5 introduced a method to let web designers take control over the viewport, through the tag. You should include the following viewport element in all your web pages: 

meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" .
